# [Start Bootstrap - Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)

# INFO

This site has been made with the help of a template. I am not the best at webdesign and wanted a simple blog for my projects. This is why I chose to use this template.

My main site: [www.benoitballiu.be](https://www.benoitballiu.be)
